This project extends smart home automation by enabling hand gesture recognition to control devices.
Instead of only voice commands (like Alexa), users can use simple hand gestures to turn devices ON/OFF/STOP.

The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on gesture images and integrates with smart home device control. Tech Stack

Python 3
TensorFlow / Keras for CNN model
OpenCV for real-time video capture & preprocessing
NumPy, Matplotlib for utilities & visualization
